# ROS Intro

This is a tiny introduction to ROS. There are three parts to the content:

1. Installing ROS on your Raspberry Pi - go [here](./Installation/README.md).

1. A simple messaging demo with no hardware required - go [here](./MessageDemo/README.md).

1. Adding movement control and a motion sensor to a robot using ROS [here](./MovementDemo/README.md).

If you are having problems with this (or any other ROS installation) you can find answers to frequently asked questions [here](./FAQ/README.md).

Have fun!
