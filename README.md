# ROS Intro

This is a tiny introduction to ROS. There are three parts to the content:

1. Installing ROS on your Raspberry Pi - go [here](Installation.md).

1. A simple messaging demo with no hardware required - go [here](MessageDemo.md).

1. Adding movement control and a motion sensor to a robot using ROS [here](MovementDemo.md).

If you are having problems with this (or any other ROS installation) you can find answers to frequently asked questions [here](FAQ.md).
